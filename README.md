![DESAIN-RANGKAIAN](https://github.com/11neuty/WaterTank-monitoring/assets/49444532/37105847-54ec-426a-87c7-7ea06ad26224)

## Project Description
The "Water Tank Monitoring" project is a solution for monitoring the water level in a 400-liter capacity tank using an ESP32 microcontroller and an HC-SR05 ultrasonic sensor. The sensor's water level data is sent to the Google Firebase platform for real-time monitoring and analysis.

### Background
Monitoring the water level in a water tank is a critical task in various applications, including household water supply, agriculture, or industry. This project aims to provide an efficient and real-time solution for monitoring and managing the water level in a 400-liter capacity tank.

### Key Features
This project includes several key features, including:

1. **Real-Time Monitoring**: The HC-SR05 ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the water level in the tank in real-time. The generated data is continuously updated and available for monitoring.

2. **Firebase Connection**: Water level data measured by the ESP32 is sent to Google Firebase, a secure cloud platform for storing and managing data. Users can easily access this data through a web application or mobile device.

3. **Notifications**: The project can be configured to send notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) when the water level reaches a certain threshold. This helps in more efficient water supply management.

4. **Graphs and Analysis**: Water level data can be used to create graphs and analyze long-term trends. This can assist in water consumption monitoring and better planning.

## How to Use Water Tank Monitoring
1. **Install the Sensor**: Install the HC-SR05 ultrasonic sensor inside the water tank so that the sensor can accurately measure the water level.

2. **ESP32 Configuration**: Connect the ESP32 to the ultrasonic sensor and configure the device to send data to Google Firebase. Ensure you have set up a Firebase account and adjust the configuration according to your account information.

3. **Access Data**: Use a web application or mobile device to access the water level data that has been uploaded to Firebase. You can view the current water level, trend graphs, and receive notifications if necessary.
